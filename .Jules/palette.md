## 2024-05-24 - Form Field Accessibility: Explicit Label Associations
**Learning:** Found a recurring accessibility issue in this app's form components (`InquiryForm`, `Newsletter`) where labels visually indicate the purpose of an input, but lack programmatic association (missing `htmlFor` and `id` links). This prevents screen readers from announcing the label when the input is focused, and stops users from clicking the label to focus the input.
**Action:** When creating or reviewing forms, always ensure every `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` has a unique `id` attribute, and its corresponding `<label>` has an `htmlFor` attribute matching that `id`. For inputs without visible labels (like inline newsletter signups), use an explicitly associated label with the `sr-only` class to maintain design while ensuring screen reader accessibility.
